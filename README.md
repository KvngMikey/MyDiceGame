# MyDiceGame

This is a dice rolling game with two players.

A player wins when he has a score of over 20points and he loses all his points if he rolls a 1...

 A player can choose to hold the number of points he has gained before getting to 20 to avoid rolling a 1 and losing all his points.
 
 This was a fun game for me to build to test and perfect my Javascript skills.
